# SmartGreenhouse/Estufa Inteligente

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the creation of a Smart Greenhouse, an initiative that combines the power of artificial inteligence with hardware solutions to optimize plant cultivation in controlled environments.

#Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a smart greenhouse capable of providing an ideal growth environment for plants, using fuzzy logic for decision-making and efficient integration with specialized hardware.

#Technologies Used

Fuzzy Logic: Fuzzy logic will be employed to create an intelligent control system, dynamically adapting to environmental conditions to maximize plant growth.
Integrated Hardware: Various hardware components will be used to monitor and control factors such as temperature, humidity, light, and others, aiming to maintain optimal conditions in the greenhouse.
Repository Structure

/src: Includes the project source code, with subdirectories organized according to specific greenhouse components.
